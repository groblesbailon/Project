This project solves the 2D Poisson and Laplace equations with 4 given boundary conditions. 
In this folder you will find two additional folders. 
The first one is the doc folder. Here you will find the Project Report with all the results and observations made once the code was able to solve the problem. Additionally, a System Information text file displays the technical specifications of the computer used.
The second one is the src folder. Here you will find the code written for this project, the plots obtained during the simulation of the code, and an excel file with the comparison graphs.
